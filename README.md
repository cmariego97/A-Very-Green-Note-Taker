# A-Very-Green-Note-Taker

## Description

This project implements Express concepts to create an application that connects front-end and back-end developments.

This application allows the user to create notes, save notes, and also delete the notes.

This project helped me become more familiar with using Express and the Heroku application to deploy my application.
